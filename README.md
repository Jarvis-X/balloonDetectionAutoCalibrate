# balloonDetectionAutoCalibrate
A robotic blimp project submodule that allows users to calibrate for customized color. Lots of things pending.

## Usage
### Calibrate:
Type in your terminal: `python main.py cvcam 1`

Run the program while the target balloon is present in front of the cameras. A very small window will show up. 
Make sure the main color of the balloon is captured in that small window and wait for ~5 seconds till the window closes. 
A `.dat` file should be generated by the program in the same directory of the `main.py` file.

### Detection:
Type in your terminal: `python main.py cvcam` and let the camera see the object.

## TODO
- pi camera integration
  - if possible, offload the computation to pixy
- blob detection
- better filter both post-detection and in-detection
